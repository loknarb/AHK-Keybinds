# Thanks for stopping

### These are a couple of my current keybindings for several situations

## Anki
  I needed to create a quick way for me to be able to go through cards quick

## German/Deutsch Alphabet
  I don't like foreign keyboards, QWERTY or die. 
  Works with Shift and Alt Modifiers to mimic German Letters

## Test Coding Hotkeys
  This a lot of repetitive code and designed really poorly.
  BUT, it works perfectly when coding I can stay relatively focused and not have to use my mouse. This was maybe inspired by vim idk?

  Don't try to mimic this there are probably better practices (ex Vim Keyboard Shortcuts), I've just grown quite used to this form of programming.
